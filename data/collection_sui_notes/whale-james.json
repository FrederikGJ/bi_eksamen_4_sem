{"lastName": "r\"whale\"", "firstName": "r\"james\"", "suicideNote": "r\"To ALL I LOVE,\nDo not grieve for me. My nerves are all shot and for the last year I have been in agony day and night \u2014 except when I sleep with sleeping pills \u2014 and any peace I have by day is when I am drugged by pills.\nI have had a wonderful life but it is over and my nerves get worse and I am afraid they will have to take me away. So please forgive me, all those I love and may God forgive me too, but I cannot bear the agony and it [is] best for everyone this way. The future is just old age and illness and pain. Goodbye and thank you for all your love. I must have peace and this is the only way. Jimmy. PS: Do not let my family come \u2014 my last wish is to be cremated so nobody will grieve over my grave. No one is to blame \u2014 I have wonderful friends and they do all they can for me, but my heart is in my mouth all the time and I have no peace. I cannot keep still and the future would be worse. My financial affairs are all in order and I hope will help my loved ones to forget a little. It will be a great shock, but I pray they will be given strength to come through and be happy for my release from this constant fear. I've tried very hard all I know for a year and it gets worse inside, so please take comfort in knowing I will not suffer anymore.
