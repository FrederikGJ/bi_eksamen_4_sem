# Introduction

### Mental health and suicide - global and personal perspectives

    
    # the questions - the macro and the micro perspective - quantitative and qualitative data

    You often read news about the mental health crisis among young people all over the world. 
    Some goes as far as calling it a mental health pandemic. In our project we want to investigate this,
    by looking at quantitative data from the WHO (World Health Organisation) and qualitative data from
    a collection of suicide notes.
    We use suicide rates as a proxy for the mental health state of peoples across the globe. 
    And the suicide notes to investigate the subjective mental state of someone who is severely depressed.

    #st.write("In the data we are using from WHO, there are serious confounders. The data quality for different countries varies immensely. Most countries do not have data on the total population. It is only the Scandinavian countries that have valid data on the total population with things like the CPR number, centralised source taxation, and so on. These measures ensure accurate data tracking of every single individual and company in the country.")
